\alias{calc_weights}
\title{Function to calculate the weights for replicate fitting (these weights are the inverse of the variance at each time point).}
\usage{
calc_weights(current_gene, num_reps, genes)
}
\arguments{
\item{current_gene}{row number of gene being examined}

\item{num_reps}{number of replicates}

\item{genes}{data frame of genes with the following specifications: first row is column labels, first column has gene labels/names, and all other columns have expression data. This expression data must be ordered by time point then by replicate, and must have evenly spaced time points. Any missing data must have cells left blank.}
}
\value{
the variance of replicates at a certain time point
}
